# Vehicle Detection Project

This repository contains code for a vehicle detection project using deep learning. It's designed to be run in Google Colab.

## Contents

- `notebooks/Part1_Vehicle_Detection.ipynb`: The original notebook with the vehicle detection code
- `Vehicle_Detection_Colab.ipynb`: A Colab-ready version of the notebook
- `images/`: A small sample of the vehicle images (the full dataset is much larger)
- `labels.csv`: A sample of the labels file with bounding box coordinates

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your Google Drive
2. Open the `Vehicle_Detection_Colab.ipynb` file in Google Colab
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up and run the project

## Full Dataset

This repository contains only a small sample of the full dataset. The complete dataset includes:
- Over 110,000 unique vehicle images
- Labels for different vehicle types (car, bus, truck, etc.)
- Bounding box coordinates for each vehicle

## Note

This is a sample repository for the PGAIML Capstone project. The full project includes more data and functionality.
